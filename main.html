            <div>My mother had me perform in a kindergarten talent show in my hometown of Colorado Springs. Stage addiction set in after winning 1st place. I continued to perform and develop skills, including TV commercials and re-enactment work.</p> While stationed with the Navy, we hired a DJ. I asked to use the mic and really got the crowd going. The DJ was so impressed he offered me a job. Since then I’ve become a TOP wedding DJ for 15 of the last 19 years.</p> When not DJ-ing I’m enjoying anything I can put Sriracha on and spending time with my beautiful fiancé, who has helped me grow to who I am today.</div>

            <div>My first chance on a microphone was a speech at my eighth grade awards ceremony, the adrenaline rush translated into excitement as words came out. Years later, while training as a DJ, I felt that same adrenaline rush of excitement—I just knew.</p> Growing up to many music genres, thanks to my parents, prepared me for a later DJ life. With such an appreciation for music, song rotation comes easy for me.</p> It’s a great thrill to see smiles on people’s faces, watch them dance, have fun and know I did that. When not DJ-ing, I enjoy time with my wife and four children, and eating Italian food.</div>

          <h2>A Few Questions I Get</h2>
          <p>Click on the buttons to read my responses</p>

          <button class="accordion">What advice do you have for a customer looking to hire a provider like you?</button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>Every bride I meet with I ask them to tell me about the last wedding they attended. 9 out of 10 brides say the last wedding they went to was horrible! That means there are a lot more bad DJs out there than good! Every DJ is going to tell you they are the best. Ask around. Has anyone else heard of this DJ? Ask your other wedding professionals. Check references, websites, and social media.</p>
          </div>

          <button class="accordion">If you were a customer, what do you wish you knew about your trade? Any insider secrets to share?</button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>People tend to think a DJ is a DJ is DJ. All DJs are not the same. Just because a DJ is amazing at a night club doesn’t mean he knows how to DJ a wedding. I’ll tell you a secret… Most night club DJs do not like to talk on a microphone. That’s kind of an important part of a wedding DJ. A wedding is a ceremonial tradition that needs to be handled with some sophistication. Your DJ needs to also be an MC and be able to introduce traditions with class and grace…</p>
          </div>

          <button class="accordion">Why does your work stand out from others who do what you do?</button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>Most DJs stay behind the DJ booth and just play music. I get out on the floor and interact with your guest.</p>
          </div>

          <button class="accordion">What do you like most about your job?</button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>Helping couples make their wedding something no one will forget.</p>
          </div>

          <button class="accordion">What questions do customers most commonly ask you? What's your answer?</button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>Why am I more expensive than other DJs? Quality and experience are not cheap. I have well over 500 amazing weddings under my belt. Do you really want to entrust your once in a lifetime special day to the lowest bidder? Remember, you get what you pay for… A Cheap DJ isn’t good and a good DJ isn’t Cheap</p>
          </div>

          <button class="accordion">Do you have a favorite story from your work?</button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>Too many!</p>
          </div>

          <button class="accordion">What do you wish customers knew about you or your profession?</button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>Out of all the professionals you hire for your wedding the DJ is the only one who does not have a piece of paper that states he has successfully completed sometime of training that would indicate he is competent and proficient in his skilled. What I mean is most the people you hire have or do have the ability to obtain a college degree in their perspective fields. This is not the case for a DJ. I’m sure somewhere in the US there is someone teaching some sort of DJ course but as far as I know there is no accredited validated educational program that churns out top notch DJs.</p>

            <hr />
            <p>I’ve been DJing professionally for over 19 yrs, and a TOP wedding DJ for the last 15. This is not a part-time job, it's a passion I take personally.</p>
            <p>I joined the Navy after high school and found myself in Jacksonville, Fl. When the ship I was stationed on was being de-commissioned we threw ourselves a party. The ship hired a DJ and during the party I went up to the DJ and asked if I could use his mic. I got on the mic and got everyone up singing, dancing, and chanting. At the end of the night the DJ came up to me and asked me if I wanted a job. I've been delivering ever since.</p>
