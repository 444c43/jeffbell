              <b>My Story:</b>

              <p>My mother had me perform in my first talent show when I was in kindergarten back in my hometown of Colorado Springs, Co. I won first place and was addicted to being on stage. I continued to perform anywhere I could. As I got older my skills grew to include singing, dancing, acting, modeling, and DJing. In my teenage years I did a lot of television work including various TV commercials, a spot on the TV show Unsolved Mysteries (I did a reenactment of a guy who claimed to have been chased by Bigfoot as a child), and I was a featured dancer on a local dance show.</p>

              <p>I joined the Navy after high school and found myself in Jacksonville, Fl. When the ship I was stationed on was being de-commissioned we threw ourselves a party. The ship hired a DJ and in hindsight, I know now that company parties are some of the most difficult parties to get people up and dancing. I went up to the DJ and asked him if I could use his mic. Everyone on my ship already knew me for being outgoing and being very entertaining so I got on the mic and got everyone up singing, dancing, and chanting. After that, it was a great party. At the end of the night, the DJ came up to me and asked me if I wanted a job. So that’s how I got into the business.</p>

              <b>Professional Stats:</b>

              <p>I’ve been DJing professionally for over 19 yrs. I’ve been one of the TOP wedding DJs for the last 15 yrs. This is not a part-time job for me. This is all I do and I take what I do very personally.</p>

              <b>Career Highlights:</b>

              <p>Performing on the Sprint Fanzone stage at The Daytona International Speedway. Being the Field MC for the Jacksonville Tomcats Arena Football team. Performing at The Jacksonville Landing stage for Pre Superbowl parties.</p>

              <b>Favorite movies:</b>

              <p>The Shawshank Redemption, The Green Mile, The Hangover, and all the Toy Story movies. What?? They’re well written!</p>

              <b>Favorite food:</b>

              <p>Crab legs, Corned Beef and Cabbage, sandwiches, and anything with Sriracha on it!</p>

              <b>Interesting fact:</b>

              <p>I produced and hosted a hit local TV show in Jacksonville called Club @ccess as seen on FOX! I was a Casting Director for about a year in LA and provide background talent for music videos including Missy Elliot’s Gossip Folks, B2K’s Girlfriend, and 50 Cent’s In Da Club.</p>

              <p>P.S. I want to thank my wonderful wife for helping me become the man I am today…</p>

            <button class="accordion team">From the first time I got on a microphone to do a speech at my eighth grade awards ceremony in front of the whole school, there was a sense of adrenaline that rushed through me that translated to excitement as the words came out of my mouth.<p><b>[click to read more]</b></p></button>
            <div class="panel">
              <b>MC Story:</b>
              <p>I’m just glad my voice didn’t crack because you never know at that age! The way everyone stopped talking and listen to me made a lasting impression on me. I didn’t know until many years later on what I had and what I’d come to enjoy. I was training as a DJ for a former company I worked for before going on my own. He handed me the microphone and told me to make an announcement. Once again the adrenaline kicked in and I made the announcement stopping the crowd from what they were doing to completely transition to do something else. Afterward, he came up to me and said I think we found our next emcee. After some additional training, I was doing events as the lead MC & DJ.</p>

              <b>DJ Story:</b>
              <p>I didn’t start to DJ until 1998. I didn’t realize that growing up and listening to all sorts of different genres, thanks to my parents, growing up on how much it would help me. I was born outside of Cleveland but was raised in Harrisburg, Pa. Every weekend helping my dad work on cars and doing the list of chores my mom would give me, they had music playing from “The Oldies” station. Even driving to St. Augustine for vacations they had control of the music back then. I grew an appreciation of the music that came before my time and knew without the past we would never enjoy the music we listen to today. When I started to DJ weddings, Bar & Bar Mitzvahs, and other adult events, I knew what the adults wanted to hear and dance to. The rotation of songs came easy to me. This song would go great with this and that one. I did some local clubs in the early years but knew that the mobile DJ industry was where I wanted to be.</p>

              <b>Entertainment Story:</b>
              <p>It all started when I was in third grade. We started to dance while on recess. That’s right, duct-taping cardboard together turning on the music and break it down. We would draw crowds even the teachers got in on it! We would perform at talent shows. It was fun, we all hung out doing that while playing sports. I also played the drums or “percussion” from 4th grade through Graduation. We would perform with the band on competitions and even marching band after football was over. That would help me out with DJ’n and understanding matching songs up to the BPM (Beats Per Minute). When I grew older I moved down here in 1996 and started to go out with the friends I met. The dancing bug came out again and I was out there on the stage or dance box drawing the attention and feeding off the energy of the crowd. Every weekend I looked forward to going out entertaining thinking it would be cool to get paid for doing this. Then this guy Jeff, came up to me one night impressed on what I was doing and asked if I wanted to get paid for doing what I was doing in the night club. After my first wedding as a party host (dancer), March of 1998 at Deercreek Country Club, I was hooked!</p>

              <b>Summary:</b>
              <p>Whether it’s dancing, Dj’n or emceeing I get a thrill performing and putting smiles on your family and friends faces. It’s rewarding in and of itself seeing people dance and have fun, knowing that I did that. I’m also honored and blessed to be a part of someone’s memories that they will cherish and look back upon with a smile knowing how much fun they had! I look forward to providing that for you as well!</p>

              <b>Other Fun Stuff:</b>
              <p>I like to spend time with the wife and kids as much as I can. We have four, two that have graduated high school and two that are in Middle school. I also like eating great Italian food which is one of the many reasons I love my wife so much. Her family runs two Italian restaurants in town. Going alphabetically is Enza’s Italian Restaurant and Vito’s Italian Restaurant. Check them out! I’m constantly on a diet, lol! I also like to surf fish as well. When it comes to watching TV, I watch whatever the kids are watching unless it’s football season then Game On! LOL God help our Jags!!</p>

            <button class="accordion team">I picked up DJing as a hobby in 2010. I love all different types of music and exploring how they can mix and bring out different emotions.<p><b>[click to read more]</b></p></button>
            <div class="panel">
              <b>What type of events do you enjoy DJing?</b>
              <p>My favorite events are any with lots of energy and excitement. From getting friends and family to celebrate a wedding with every ounce of dancing they have to bring the intensity to a big competition.</p>

              <b>What’s your favor DJ memory?</b>
              <p>My favorite DJ memories are from times when I had the biggest challenges. Packing a dance floor after a bride and groom tell me their friends and family probably won’t dance at all.</p>

              <b>What’s your hobby or other interests</b>
              <p>I’m also a weightlifting and CrossFit instructor as well as being a competitive weightlifter. Also have an electrical engineering degree.</p>

              <b>How long have you been doing it?</b>
              <p>DJ-ing started as a hobby and grew from there. I was also very interested in fitness and found a way to combine the two and started DJing at  fitness competitions and events. From there I grew into doing weddings and other parties.</p>

            <h2>A Few Questions I Get</h2>
            <p>Click on the buttons to read my responses</p>

            <button class="accordion">What advice do you have for a customer looking to hire a provider like you?</button>
            <div class="panel">
              <p>Every bride I meet with I ask them to tell me about the last wedding they attended. 9 out of 10 brides say the last wedding they went to was horrible! That means there are a lot more bad DJs out there than good! Every DJ is going to tell you they are the best. Ask around. Has anyone else heard of this DJ? Ask your other wedding professionals. Check references, websites, and social media.</p>
            </div>

            <button class="accordion">If you were a customer, what do you wish you knew about your trade? Any insider secrets to share?</button>
            <div class="panel">
              <p>People tend to think a DJ is a DJ is DJ. All DJs are not the same. Just because a DJ is amazing at a night club doesn’t mean he knows how to DJ a wedding. I’ll tell you a secret… Most night club DJs do not like to talk on a microphone. That’s kind of an important part of a wedding DJ. A wedding is a ceremonial tradition that needs to be handled with some sophistication. Your DJ needs to also be an MC and be able to introduce traditions with class and grace…</p>

            <button class="accordion">Why does your work stand out from others who do what you do?</button>
            <div class="panel">
              <p>Most DJs stay behind the DJ booth and just play music. I get out on the floor and interact with your guest.</p>
            </div>

            <button class="accordion">What do you like most about your job?</button>
            <div class="panel">
              <p>Helping couples make their wedding something no one will forget.</p>
            </div>

            <button class="accordion">What questions do customers most commonly ask you? What's your answer?</button>
            <div class="panel">
              <p>Why am I more expensive than other DJs? Quality and experience are not cheap. I have well over 500 amazing weddings under my belt. Do you really want to entrust your once in a lifetime special day to the lowest bidder? Remember, you get what you pay for… A Cheap DJ isn’t good and a good DJ isn’t Cheap</p>
            </div>

            <button class="accordion">Do you have a favorite story from your work?</button>
            <div class="panel">
              <p>Too many!</p>
            </div>

            <button class="accordion">What do you wish customers knew about you or your profession?</button>
            <div class="panel">
              <p>Out of all the professionals you hire for your wedding the DJ is the only one who does not have a piece of paper that states he has successfully completed sometime of training that would indicate he is competent and proficient in his skilled. What I mean is most the people you hire have or do have the ability to obtain a college degree in their perspective fields. This is not the case for a DJ. I’m sure somewhere in the US there is someone teaching some sort of DJ course but as far as I know there is no accredited validated educational program that churns out top notch DJs.</p>

              <p>I’ve been DJing professionally for over 19 yrs, and a TOP wedding DJ for the last 15. This is not a part-time job, it's a passion I take personally.</p>
              <p>I joined the Navy after high school and found myself in Jacksonville, Fl. When the ship I was stationed on was being de-commissioned we threw ourselves a party. The ship hired a DJ and during the party I went up to the DJ and asked if I could use his mic. I got on the mic and got everyone up singing, dancing, and chanting. At the end of the night the DJ came up to me and asked me if I wanted a job. I've been delivering ever since.</p>
