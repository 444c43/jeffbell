										<p>In one seminar you will learn valuable tips on affectively advertising your business AND only to people actually interested in your product or service.</p>

										<p>You’ll learn how to understand SEO, Google Adwords, Google My Business, and so much more. We’ll also teach you what I feel is the <b>MOST</b> important part of ALL of this: How to outsource your advertising so YOU don't have to do it yourself.</p>

										<p>A quick lesson in Outsourcing:</p>

										<p><i>Do you change your own oil?</i> Some yes, but most outsource.
										<br>
										<i>Do you perform dentistry on yourself?</i> Hopefully all say <b><u>NO</u></b>. Everyone should outsource this.</p>

										<p>Outsourcing just means hiring a professional who is more skilled than you are at something. Be honest, do you really know what you are doing when it comes to advertising? How many of you spend hours trying to market your business and are NOT seeing results from your efforts? Wouldn't your time be better spend doing YOUR actual business?</p>

										<p>Did you know 100% of every dollar you spend on adverting is 100% tax deductible? Which means if you outsource your marketing & advertising 100% of ALL the money you spend will be deducted. 100%!! Doesn't it seem silly NOT to advertise? You can either spend $1000 investing in growing your business and get 100% back in tax deductions or just give all that money to the government next April.</p>

										<p>So now you are advertising. But that’s not all! Next you need to know how to manage all those new phone calls and emails you're receiving. Well your in luck! Because my partner DL is going to blow your mind with tips and tricks to help you with Customer Management Relations.</p>

										<p>Join us as DL, a 24+ year technology veteran leads us in improving our understanding of technology. He'll walk you through an entire email campaign from start to finish. This includes loading and organizing contacts, setting up different campaigns and sending an actual email--all live! Later, he'll walk you through three MS Office products that are (or should be) core to your businesses: Outlook, Excel and OneNote. He'll teach you how to manage and organize those many emails, quickly manipulate data in Excel and keep notes (and share them with your team) through OneNote.</p>

										<p>Lastly, he'll show some of his favorite tips and tricks when working on a computer. As a great bonus, he'll also cover using your mobile device and discuss wide variety of apps that you can use to ensure technology works for you and boosts your productivity.</p>

										<p>It's sure to be a great series of talks--and only for $99. That's right, only $99 for the <i>entire</i> day! When you walk away you'll be empowered to take your business to the next level with productivity.</p>
